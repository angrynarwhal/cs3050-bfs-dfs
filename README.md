# cs3050-bfs-dfs
Pythonic Example of breadth first and depth first search

1.	Step-by-step buildup:
 - Start with graph construction from the provided input format.
 - Visualize simple graph examples to introduce nodes and edges.
 - Implement BFS, showing node discovery order and distances.
 - Implement DFS, showing discovery and finish times.
 - Apply both algorithms to network-like graphs (small-world structures, grid networks).
2.	Progressive Examples:
 - Example 1: Simple undirected graph (3-4 nodes).
 - Example 2: Directed graph (5-6 nodes).
 - Example 3: Network structure (like a grid or small-world).
3.	Final Demonstration:
 - Input parsing from stdin or file (matching the C assignment format).
 - Full BFS and DFS traversal with output formatting:
 - BFS shows distances.
 - DFS shows finish times.
